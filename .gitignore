#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.

# Machine Learning related ignores (crucial for your project)
artifacts/          # Ignore the entire 'artifacts' directory and its contents recursively
extracted_data/     # Ensure this is also present if 'extracted_data' is at the root level as well
logs/               # Ignore log files and directories
